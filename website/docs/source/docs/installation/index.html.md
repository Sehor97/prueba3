# Installing Provider
First, make sure that you have [Parallels Desktop for Mac](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/)
and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) properly installed.
We recommend you using the latest versions of these products.

Since the Parallels provider is a Vagrant plugin, installing it is easy:

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels
```

The Vagrant plugin installer will automatically download and install
`vagrant-parallels` plugin.

## Requirements
- Vagrant v1.8 or higher (_there are known issues with Vagrant v1.9.5
[[GH-297](https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues/297#issuecomment-304458691)]
and v1.9.6 [[GH-301]](https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues/301)_)
- Parallels Desktop for Mac version 11 or higher
